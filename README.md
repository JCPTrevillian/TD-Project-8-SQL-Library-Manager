SQL Library Manager 

In this project I will demonstrate my abilities working with databases through storing, retrieving, updating and deleting information. 

I created a web application for listing, adding, updating, and deleting books in a library application. 

This project uses: JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
